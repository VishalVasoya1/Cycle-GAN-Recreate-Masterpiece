# CycleGAN for Photo to Monet Painting Generator

ðŸŽ¨ This project contains a CycleGAN implementation for generating monet-style paintings from photos. 

## Steps to Train the Model

### Step 1: CycleGAN Training
* The `CycleGAN_training` folder contains the Python code required to train the CycleGAN model on your own dataset.
* Before running the training code, you can customize the training parameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size according to your requirements.
* After the training is complete, the model will be saved to the `Model` folder for later use.

### Step 2: Trained Model
* The `Model` folder contains the trained CycleGAN model for generating monet-style paintings from photos and vice versa.
* You can use this pre-trained model to generate monet-style paintings from your own photos or use it as a starting point for further fine-tuning and experimentation.

## Step 3: Performance

The `performance` folder contains visualizations of the trained model's performance. You can see how well the model is able to convert photos to monet-style paintings and vice versa.

ðŸš€ Now you are ready to generate monet-style paintings from your own photos using CycleGAN!
